# About
In this Repo I save all my Selfmade Serum Presets.

# Installation
If you want to install them you can use git or do it manually.

## Install via Git
- Open a Comandline of your choice. (On Windows please use Powershell)
- Enter your Serum Preset directory:
  - Windows: cd "~/Documents/Xfer/Serum Presets/Presets"
  - UNIX: cd ~/Library/Audio/Presets/Xfer\ Records/Serum\ Presets/Presets
- Clone the git repo: git clone https://github.com/maximizzar/serum-presets
- Rename the directory: mv serum-presets maximizzar

## Install Manually
- Download the repo as a zip.
- Extract the archive into a directory, name it i.e. maximizzar, and move it into the presets location:
  - Windows: "~/Documents/Xfer/Serum Presets/Presets"
  - UNIX: ~/Library/Audio/Presets/Xfer\ Records/Serum\ Presets/Presets
